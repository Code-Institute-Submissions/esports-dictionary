# Testing Details
[README.md file](https://github.com/mark-obeirne/esports-dictionary/blob/master/README.md)

This document includes details of sites used for validation and testing, how manual testing was accomplished, and issues faced over the course of this project's completion.

### Validators and Tools
[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) - Every page across the site was input directly into this service, resulting in no highlighted errors. This was done in a state of being logged in and logged out for thoroughness.

[W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - No errors were highlighted after inputting the style.css file into this service.

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) - JSHint highlighted unused variable errors in relation to the initialisation of Materialise components. One error was highlighted in relation to custom JS whereby the EmailJS variables were undeclared. Scripts relating to this page are, however, found on the Contact page alone and were inaccessible by this online tool when testing.

[ESPrima (JS)](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html) - Code was returned as being syntactically valid.

[Pep8 Online](http://pep8online.com/checkresult) - No errors were highlighted when testing Python code.

[Web Accessibility by Level access](https://www.webaccessibility.com/) - Esports Dictionary received a compliance rating of 92%. One note highlighted that it is best practice to provide warning in relation to links that open new windows, which is the case with the icons in the footer. 

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/http://esports-dictionary.herokuapp.com/) - After fixing highlighted errors, no further errors were flagged. Contrast errors were highlighted however. These related to text that is visible to screen readers only and text that appears over the jumbotron image where the background colour of this image is ignored. To ensure that there is adequate contrast used across the site, Google's Developer Tools have been utilised extensively throughout the project.



## Manual Testing
### Devices Used for Testing
Please note that this project does not support Internet Explorer due to the use of ES6 features and notation. Esports Dictionary was tested on a variety of devices, including:

Dell Laptop
* Google Chrome
* Microsoft Edge
* Mozilla Firefox

Samsung Galaxy S10 Mobile
* Google Chrome

iPhone 8 Mobile


### Manual Testing Process
While testing this site, a regular user and an admin account were utilised to check behaviour across these usergroups. In addition, many functions were tested while logged out to ensure that some defensive programming measures were in place.

#### Register Functionality
1. Click on the Register button while logged out and ensure that the page loads
2. Enter a username
3. Enter a password
4. Enter a mismatched password when confirming password. Ensure that this is highlighted as invalid and the submit button disables.
5. Click Register
    * If the username is available, the user should be logged in, redirected to the homepage, and greeted with a flash message
    * If the username is currently in use, the page should reload and a flash message should inform the user that they have to choose another username

##### Additional Checks
* While logged in, attempt to access the register page directly via the link. Ensure that the homepage is loaded with a flash message informing the user that they are already registered and logged in. 
* Click on link to log in page. Ensure that the correct page loads.
* Attempt to sign up with a swear word as a username. The page should reload and inform the user that this username is unavailable. Testing has found that there are some workarounds despite better-profanity's ability to swap in numbers for letters and match swear words.
* Try to sign up with the same username as another user but in a different case. Ensure that the user is informed that they cannot use this username.

#### Log In Functionality
1. Click on the Log In button while logged out and ensure that the page loads.

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions
### Edit / Delete Buttons
Initially, usernames as strings were utilised to record who had submitted a term. This made the process of checking the session user cookie against the username in the submitted_by field very straightforward. However, my mentor indicated that it would be better to utilise IDs as foreign keys to allow for any changes to usernames to be reflected. Some refactoring was done, but this made the process of displaying usernames next to definitions more tricky. 

I decided against setting a session cookie with the user's id for security. Consulting the Jinja documentation, it seemed that a namespace object would be a good approach to take. This enabled me to run a loop over the list of users in the database and show the username whose ID matched the ID of the submitter. Then if the user accessing the page had the same username as the username displayed under a definition, they could be shown the admin buttons to edit or delete a term.

### Ratings
It was important to be able to rate definitions without leaving the page or forcing users to reload the page. When researching potential solutions, I found an idea [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21566649/flask-button-run-python-without-refreshing-page) that utilised AJAX. This enabled me to run a JavaScript function that could get the ID of the term being rated, handle the feedback on the front end, and pass data (such as the term's ID, to the backend for updating.

### Sticky Navbar
Identifying that the dictionary could be quite long when left unfiltered, I tested a sticky navbar. However, on mobile, the search filters section is also sticky so that it is readily accessible. This resulted in a lot of screen real estate being taken up as the user scrolled down (as well as an overlap of the navbar and the search section).

Initially, I experimented with JavaScript to hide elements within the search section when the screen was scrolled down to a certain point. While some experimenting enabled the headings to hide or display relatively smoothly and other elements to move upwards into this freed up space, there was a point on the page where the function would meet the hide conditions and when hidden, the window scrollY value would cause the elements to display again. 

In the end, I decided that a more elegant approach would be to include a Floating Action Button on each page. This provides users with quick access to important navigation links, and doesn't take up a lot of space.

### Submit Definition
Users were able to submit definitions without being able to select a game from the dropdown menu. Adding required to the select element simply resulted in the form not submitting, but there was no indication as to why the form would not submit. As a result, asterisks were added to the required form elements and the button's default behaviour was set to be disabled (as is the case on the registration page). When the user completes all necessary fields, including selecting an option from the game dropdown, a JavaScript function enables the button so that the definition can be submitted.

### Any known issues?
#### Search Terms Game Dropdown
While the text searchbar is cleared if any other filter is applied, the game dropdown remains set to the last selected filter. Attempts to update the class of the first item to selected or setting the value of the option element have proven fruitless so far.
