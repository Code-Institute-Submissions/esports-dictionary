## Summary
Esports Dictionary is a user-generated collection of definitions of terms used in relation to competitive gaming, a.k.a Esports.

## Background
While video games have often traditionally had an element of competition to them, whether that be the in-built high score featured (which has led to spirited competition for Guinness World Records) or more formal events like Nintendo's first World Championships in 1990, the idea of competitive gaming - or Esports as it is otherwise known - has grown exponentially in recent years.

In recent years, The International - the biggest competition for Dota 2 teams - has seen its prize pool grow from $1.6 million to more than $34 million in 2019; League of Legends' Worlds finals were watched by more 99.6 million unique viewers; and traditional sports stars and teams, including Michael Jordan, Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, Fernando Alonso, Munster Rugby, Manchester City, PSG, and Valencia CF, among many others have invested in teams or have signed players or teams to compete under their brand.

In 2020, with sports on hiatus, some sports stars took to competing virtually, while TV channels aired Esports matches. F1 drivers took to the track as part of the [F1 Esports Virtual Grand Prix series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwcRDOjgfkE), Premiership soccer players [played out a cancelled derby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meoe145_Itk&feature=emb_title), and [Fox Sports aired Nascar's iRacing series](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/with-stadiums-closed-tv-networks-turn-to-live-esports-broadcasts). 

Esports is no longer a niche topic where superstars exist only in South Korea, or attention-grabbing headlines are confined to one-off publicity events such as a [match against a developer for a Ferrari](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/meet-dennis-thresh-fong-the-original-pro-gamer-103208/). 

## Aim of the Site
The purpose of Esports Dictionary is to act as a go-to guide for esports terminology. Tuning into an esports broadcast can be intimidating: there is a lot of action happening on screen (and at times even if you play the game it can seem like they're playing a completely different game with the skills and techniques on display), and the commentators use terms and sayings that aren't commonplace in day-to-day life.

The site aims to connect those in the know and those that understand the lingo with those who are delving into this world, possibly for the first time. As the site grows and develops a more thorough dictionary of terms, an aim is to expand by connecting with cartoonists to bring some of the terms to life in the form of cute and amusing A-Z books aimed at gamers who are also parents of young children. 

While there are sites that have written articles about esports terminology, our research has found that they tend to be surface level terms or, where they do go into more depth, tend to focus on one particular game. A drawback of the coverage to date is that these glossaries are usually in article form and therefore remain static until it comes time to write another article with a release timed around a major event. The alternative is to consult Reddit and hope that there is an all-encompassing post with the terminology required, but that requires a knowledge of where to find such information and how to navigate to it.

Esports Dictionary is different as it can evolve over time, draws upon the knowledge of a community, can provide more context through the use of YouTube links, and is easy to navigate.

## Scope
The site's main target are passionate gamers who know the lexicon of gaming and, in particular, Esports. These users will shape the site by contributing definitions and rating on those that provide the most detail or accuracy. However, as Esports reaches new audiences, it will target these newcomers who want to learn more and develop a greater understanding of the words being used in association with this entertainment industry.

### User Stories
#### Users
"As an Esports fanatic, I want to be able to share my knowledge so that more people can enjoy this passion of mine."

"As a parent, I want to learn more about my child's hobby, so that I can connect with them and spend some more quality time with them."

"As a sports fan who stumbled upon gaming coverage during lockdown, I would like to be able to understand what the commentators are talking about, so that I can enjoy the action more."

#### Site Owner
"As the site owner, I would like to build a comprehensive glossary of gaming and Esports terms so that the site is the go-to resource when someone wants to find out what a gaming term means."

"As the site owner, I want to be able to find ways to reward users for getting involved, so that they will help to contribute to this database of knowledge."

"As the site owner, I would like to leverage this database of knowledge in the future by selling books on the topic, so that we have another revenue stream."

## Site Features
### Jumbotron
When a user visits the homepage, they are greeted by a visually-appealing jumbotron. If the user is logged in, they are invited to add a term as this is one of the core experiences and goals of the site. If the user is currently logged out, they will instead be presented with two buttons, one to login and one to register. 

### Search Filters
As the site grows and more terms are added, it becomes more integral to be able to filter the available information to what is most relevant to the user. 

It is possible to filter displayed terms and definitions based on three criteria:
* The user can search for a particular term by typing it in and the list of terms will filter as they type
* Search for all terms associated with a particular supported game
* Filter alphabetically and only show definitions of a particular letter

On both mobile and desktop, these search filters are readily accessible at all times when viewing the dictionary. The mobile and tablet versions of the site use a sidebar for the alphabetical filter to preserve some screen real estate when scrolled. 

### User Ratings
Each term has a community-granted rating associated with it. If logged in, users can upvote a definition if they like it or downvote a definition if they think it's inaccurate. Definitions that drop below -2 in rating are hidden from view; this ensures that definitions that are deemed helpful are given prominence and also helps to counteract troublesome users and spam.

When a user presses the up or down arrow on a given term, the rating in the database is updated to reflect this. To provide feedback to the user, the chosen arrow is highlighted and the rating on display changes to reflect their vote. This change occurs in real-time, but as the page does not display it will not reflect other user ratings that may occur in the background. When the page is refreshed again, the rating displayed will be that which is currently stored in the database.

If a user is not logged in when they click on an arrow, they are presented with a modal that encourages them to register or log in so that they can get involved.

#### Explanation of the Rating System
The rating system emulates Reddit's system. 

* If a user upvotes a definition, it is given a +1 rating. 
* If they press the upvote arrow again, it is taken as an indication that they are taking this rating away and the term's rating is reduced by the 1 that they previously gave it.
* This shows a user that they can't spam the upvote or downvote button.

* If a user has upvoted a definition, but later downvote it, the rating will reduce by 2. The +1 that they originally gave it is taken away. And a -1 is subsequently applied. 
* This replicates the behaviour of a user simply downvoting a definition, i.e. giving it -1. 

### Floating Action Button
It was decided that the navbar should not be sticky as it resulted in very little screen real estate being available on mobile for definitions when combined with the sticky search filters section. To ensure that users could quickly get back to the top of the page (or to other pages that they may want to access quickly), a Floating Action Button is featured on each page. For logged in users, this button gives them quick links to the top of the page, the submit definition page, and their user profile. Logged out users are able to get back to the top of the page quickly or register for an account.

### User Profiles
Each user has a profile page, which showcases their top rated definition and all other definitions that they have submitted. This page also displays their user rating, which is an accumulation of all the ratings given to terms that they've submitted, and a star rating based on this value. This is one method that has been shown to get people to create content, and is something that we would like to expand upon in the future. This user profile also displays the user's favourite games and favourite teams or players if they provided that information on signup.

A user can edit their account details from a link on this page, enabling them to update their username or their password. When making changes to their account details, the user is required to enter their current password.

### Contact Page
The Contact Page contains a form, which invites users to get in touch with any comments, suggestions, or to report a bug. This is linked to my email through EmailJS, and once the email sends, the page redirects to the homepage through the use of a route.

### 404 Page
If a user attempts to navigate to a page that does not exist or stumbles upon a link that does not work, they are presented with a straightforward 404 page that can help them get back to the homepage easily. This page features a button that generates a gaming term from a predefined list as a fun little tie-in with the site's theme. However, the core message of "back to the homepage" remains consistent.

## Future Features
### Profile Gamification
As outlined in the Site Owner's user story, we are looking for further ways to encourage users to get involved. A rating system is one that has worked on sites such as Reddit, but we would like to expand this further. 

Achievements are an integral part of videogames and we would like to explore this avenue with achivements that would feature on a user's profile. These achievements would reward users for submissions, for submitting well-received terms, for account longevity, for filling out their profile, and more.  

### Shop
As the site depends on user submissions, it is too early to launch a shop to sell site-related merchandise. As outlined, it is planned that the shop will feature products that draw upon contributed definitions and knowledge such as cute and cartoony A-Z books aimed at parents who are gamers.

### Report Terms
While the site features a rating system, which could enable the community to prevent spam and malicious posting by downvoting submissions, we would like to go further by implementing a reporting system. This would enable users to highlight submissions to an Admin that may need to be edited or deleted. 

Admins are currently able to edit or delete any term, and this system could help them do their job more thoroughly. 

### Favourite Terms
In the future, we plan to enable users to favourite individual terms or definitions for later consultation.

## Changes to Wireframes
### Dictionary Page
On tablet, it was decided to emulate the behaviour and layout of the mobile view when it came to the Alphabetical Filters. In testing, the approach of having a sidebar slide out to allow the user to select a letter was more appealing. On larger devices, the full alphabet could be displayed without taking up too much screen real estate or seeming overwhelming.

### Manage Supported Games
In order to give each game card more space, the number of cards in each row on tablet was reduced to 2 and to 3 on desktop and larger devices.

## Structure
The navbar links available are different based on the user's logged in status, while Admins have another link available to them. The navbar features the site's logo in the centre of the page with the hamburger menu to the right on mobile. On larger devices, the logo shifts to the left-hand side of the page with the navigation options spreading out across the right.

Visitors who are logged out will be presented with these naviation links:
* Dictionary
* Register
* Log In
* Contact

Visitors who log in will see these navigation options:
* Dictionary
* Submit Definition
* My Profile
* Contact Us
* Log Out

Finally, users who are granted Admin status will see:
* Dictionary
* Submit Definition
* My Profile
* Manage Games
* Contact Us
* Log Out

This order was chosen to emphasise the dictionary for all users, which is where the bulk of the site's content lives. When a user logs in, we want the Submit Definition page to be visible as an integral part of the site, while the user's profile can present interesting information that will keep them coming back for more (particularly if they become attached to their rating).

For Admins, managing the games available should not be an every day task, while we do not expect users to be emailing frequently with issues or comments. Finally, the Log Out button is kept on the far right to adhere to traditional placement.

## Surface
### Fonts
As the site is a dictionary, Playfair Display was chosen as the font for page headings and terms. It was decided to use small caps with the first letter capitalised as it looked more appealing in testing.

Roboto was used as the font across the rest of the site as it is easily readable at a range of font-sizes, is easy on the eyes in instances where there is a lot of text (which may be the case in longer descriptions), and combines well with Playfair Display.

### Colours
Gaming websites as a whole have moved away from the black or dark websites that once populated the internet. In addition, Esports takes some of its cues from the world of sports. As highlighted by an [article on Redbull about Esports branding](https://www.redbull.com/ca-en/how-esports-branding-works), the palette of the most notable Esports teams is reds, blues, and whites. This is reminiscent of sports leagues such as the NBA and MLB. This is a palette that we wanted to utilise across the site.

The main colour featured across the site is a rich blue (#0F66D2). This acts as a perfect background colour for areas where there is text, such as the navbar, page icons, and buttons. 

A red colour (#AC1610) is used more sparingly across the site, commonly appearing as the background colour for delete buttons. It is also used as the background colour for the "Add Term" button within the jumbotron, however, as it contrasts well with the background and stands out when positioned between the blue navbar and the grey and blue elements below. 

A platinum grey (#E2E1DF) is used as the background colour across the site, enabling headings, buttons, and other elements to be the primary focus. 

Raisin black (#2D2A32) acts as the background for the collapsible headers that house terms and their short definitions, as well as the admin buttons underneath. This provides a good contrast against the rating arrows (regardless of their status), the text to describe a term, and the colour of the buttons. This colour is also used for the darker text across the site. 

Finally, a cultured white (#F5F5F4) is used as the white text in headings and in the collapsible headers. This contrasts well against the other colours used for elements without straining the eyes.

On hover, blue, red, and black elements are highlighted by changing to a colour that is 10% lighter, according to [colorbook.io](https://www.colorbook.io).

## Credits
### Code
[Using Markup to display flash messages with links](https://pythonpedia.com/en/knowledge-base/21248718/how-to-flashing-a-message-with-link-using-flask-flash-): This enabled me to feature links to the register / login page in flash messages displayed if a user attempts to complete an action that they do not have permission to do (submitting or deleting a term if logged out, for example).

[HoverCSS](https://github.com/IanLunn/Hover): This package of CSS was used to alter the behaviour of the social media icons in the footer of hover, enabling them to grow and stand out more.

[Sorting list of dictionaries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ways-sort-list-dictionaries-values-python-using-lambda-function/): As lambda functions were not something that I had much experience with to date, I consulted this guide, which pointed me in the right direction for sorting a list of dictionaries by value. This enabled me to hand over the sorting of terms to its own unique function.
