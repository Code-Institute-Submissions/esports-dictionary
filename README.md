## Summary
Esports Dictionary is a user-generated collection of definitions of terms used in relation to competitive gaming, a.k.a Esports.

## Background
While video games have often traditionally had an element of competition to them, whether that be the in-built high score featured (which has led to spirited competition for Guinness World Records) or more formal events like Nintendo's first World Championships in 1990, the idea of competitive gaming - or Esports as it is otherwise known - has grown exponentially in recent years.

In recent years, The International - the biggest competition for Dota 2 teams - has seen its prize pool grow from $1.6 million to more than $34 million in 2019; League of Legends' Worlds finals were watched by more 99.6 million unique viewers; and traditional sports stars and teams, including Michael Jordan, Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, Fernando Alonso, Munster Rugby, Manchester City, PSG, and Valencia CF, among many others have invested in teams or have signed players or teams to compete under their brand.

In 2020, with sports on hiatus, some sports stars took to competing virtually, while TV channels aired Esports matches. F1 drivers took to the track as part of the [F1 Esports Virtual Grand Prix series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwcRDOjgfkE), Premiership soccer players [played out a cancelled derby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Meoe145_Itk&feature=emb_title), and [Fox Sports aired Nascar's iRacing series](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/with-stadiums-closed-tv-networks-turn-to-live-esports-broadcasts).

## Aim of the site (Strategy)
The purpose of Esports Dictionary is to act as a go-to guide for esports terminology. Tuning into an esports broadcast can be intimidating: there is a lot of action happening on screen (and at times even if you play the game it can seem like they're playing a completely different game with the skills and techniques on display), and the commentators use terms and sayings that aren't commonplace in day-to-day life.

The site aims to connect those in the know and those that understand the lingo with those who are delving into this world, possibly for the first time. As the site grows and develops a fuller dictionary of terms, a future aim is to connect with cartoonists to bring some of the terms to life in the form of a cute and amusing A-Z book aimed at gamers who are also parents of young children.
